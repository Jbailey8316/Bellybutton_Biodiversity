# Bellybutton_Biodiversity
## Project Overview
This project I have been tasked with creating a dynamic, interactive dashboard using Plotly and then deploying it onto the web.

## Resources
* Software: Javascript, Plotly
* Data Source #1: samples.json

## Results
By using the Javascript library Plotly I was able to utilize the data from samples.json to create an interactive website to display collected sample data regarding bacterial cultures from belly buttons.
